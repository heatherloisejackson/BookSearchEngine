# BookSearchEngine
Full-Stack MERN application that allows users to search books using a Google Books API

## Description
This application uses React.js front-end, MongoDB as database, Node.js and Express.js as the server, and API. The application began as code working with a RESTful API, but was refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The use of GraphQL and Apollo allows the application to perform much better. This book search engine uses the Google Books API so avid readers can search and save books they would like to purchase. The search function brings a list of books that the user can click on individually and save to their own list of "Saved Books." When the user has purchased/read a book on their list they can then delete it.
